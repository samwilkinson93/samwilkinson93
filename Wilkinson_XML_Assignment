    The LIDO metadata schema is useful in cultural heritage, art, natural history, and technology museums for data harvesting for collection databases, aggregation portals, sharing and exposing data online, and supports multilingual portal environments (International Council of Museums International Committee for Documentation, n.a.). This array of benefits suits the type of institutions that I anticipate working with. Although there are merits to the various metadata schemas available such as Dublin Core and Encoded Archival Description that are also viable options, LIDO is a reliable and rich choice as I understand it. Choosing a metadata schema is a pivotal choice in the Digital Information Management field, especially for small museums or organizations with a focus on data sharing. Ideally the choice will lend itself to flexibility and cross over between fields that are related, and even unexpected in the present.
